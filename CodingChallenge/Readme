I have achieved by single responsibilty concept. Still there is a chance of making more independent
Performance: Performance wont be that much great. I have no where used threading. There are few places where no need to wait by main thread.
Complexity: Here instead of list if i use dictionary by grouping datatype. It will be much more faster
If i have more time, I want to do tweaks in design and data processing wise. I want to show to the user which rule is invalid and invalid data grouped by rule.
Lots of improvements with much more detailed info and clear results
